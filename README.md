# FULL STACK APP OF RICK AND MORTI

Thank you for reading this code,
this is an app required to fetch an application that will fetch information from the rick and morti api.

# HOW

both folders: Fe and BE: in separated terminals
RUN FOR FRONTEND: yarn start or npm run start.
RUN FOR BACKEND: npm run dev.

frontend server will be runing on port 3000 and backend on port 4000.
config for db are already set up.

Login with hohner.blues@gmail.com user and password: clave123.
you will be able to set favorite users or unset them.

# DUE TIMEING

things are more complex thatn seem, but if I had more time, I would have took care of more details, more testing, a signup page or log out (clear site dataI from application in browser: right click-> inspect-> go to application)

I would have done a pagination for favourites (correct the misspeling along the application from favorite to favourite :O ! )

I really hope you enjoy this application cause it's been really fun to develop!
