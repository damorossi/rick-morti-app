# FRONTEND APP OF RICK AND MORTI

Thank you for reading this code,
this is an app required to fetch an application that will fetch information from the rick and morti api.

# HOW

Login with hohner.blues@gmail.com user and password: clave123.
you will be able to set favorite users or unset them.

# DUE TIMEING

things are more complex thatn seem, but if I had more time, I would have took care of more details, more testing, a signup page or log out (clear site dataI from application in browser: right click-> inspect-> go to application)

I would have done a pagination for favourites (correct the misspeling along the application from favorite to favourite :O ! )

I really hope you enjoy this application cause it's been really fun to develop!
